# Peterson's Robotics and Innovation

Welcome to the official repository for **Peterson's Robotics and Innovation** — a future-forward robotics initiative led by Commander Naethaniel Peterson.

## 🌍 Mission
To develop autonomous robotic systems capable of operating in extreme environments, including deep ocean mining and future space deployment.

## 🔧 Core Projects
- **SpyderV1** – AI-guided scout with multi-legged terrain mobility.
- **Oracle** – Power and wire distribution system for field operations.
- **Indigo** – Ocean-ready self-sustaining marine unit using solar and wind power.
- **Land Sharks** – Harsh terrain builder bots with onboard 3D printing capabilities.

## 💡 Vision
Create a fully modular, self-replicating robotics system to support environmental research, space colonization, and sustainable infrastructure.
